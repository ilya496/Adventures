Hello everyone, if you are reading this file, I wish you good luck and enjoy the game!
Below you can find the settings for the game, by default they are those:
WIDTH = 600
HEIGHT = 400
PLAYER_STEP = 5
KEYS_UP = [K_w, K_UP]
KEYS_RIGHT = [K_d, K_RIGHT]
KEYS_DOWN = [K_s, K_DOWN]
KEYS_LEFT = [K_a, K_LEFT]
KEYS_INTERACTION = [K_SPACE]
ALL_MOVE_KEYS = [KEYS_UP, KEYS_LEFT, KEYS_DOWN, KEYS_RIGHT]
You can change them if you want, but
If you want change movement keys please write them as pygame keys,
but before it you should import them
